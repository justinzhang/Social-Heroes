Project Proposal


            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~PROJECT DESCRIPTION~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Social Heroes: A top down 'shooter' game where you are 
                               a volunteer organization in a van where
                               you 'shoot' volunteers at people in need
                               (or as some people call them, enemies).

            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are a lot of shooter games in general that I take inspiration from.
I want to emulate the side scrolling dungeons of legend of Zelda 2d games,
except with shooting as the main concept. Although it isn't a top down shooter, 
there is also the power up drops from the Metal Slug series I would like to put 
into my game. For example, I would like a rocket launcher type power up in the 
game. The originality and premise that I came up with for 'Social Heroes' is what 
I hope differentiates it from other games like it while still drawing elements 
from the genre.

            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~STRUCTURAL PLAN~~~~~~~~~~~~~


The main game file
    |             |
'Images Folder'   'pygame python files'
    |
Background,GameObject images

            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ALGORITHMIC PLAN~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The trickiest part of the project is having multiple stages of the game,
like a title screen, level 1, level 2, etc. I am accounting for this by
taking an object oriented programming approach to how my code is written.
For example the title screen is superclassed from the background class I 
wrote, and the player and enemies are superclassed from the game object class.
This will give me the organization needed to run the game seemlessly.

            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~TIMELINE PLAN~~~~~~~~~~~~~

04/20/20: Finalize level 1, which is a scrolling dungeon with different types
          of enemies, guns, a win condition, and a victory screen.

04/23/20: Create a level 2 where the map is autoscrolled with certain win/lose
          conditions. Create 2nd draft of sprites that will be close to how they
          will look in the final game. Add in sounds and music

04/27/20: Finalize options, menus, huds, any bugs. Add extra powerups.

Extra plans if there is time: Create your own level, level 3, multiplayer

            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~VERSION CONTROL PLAN~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I plan to back up my code on github. Picture is of the repo.

            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~MODULE LIST~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Random,pygame

            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~TP2 UPDATE 04/23/20~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Currently, level 1 is completely functional, and level 2 is in the works.
I spent a lot of time ironing out bugs since TP1 and I am confident that
I am reaching what I want the project to be.

As for design updates, I am not sure I want to stick to the original story
idea as I'm having trouble implementing it in the game. Currently, the game
looks pretty bland, so I was thinking of changing the setting to a more 
cyberpunk feel. I want to create at least 3 different enemies, 3 different bosses,
and 4 different guns (already achieved).

            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~TP3 UPDATE 04/23/20~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- added a main menu screen
- added a 'story'
- finished level 1 and 2
- created more high quality sprites
-fine tuned the shooting
